## A word from the designer

The idea of creating Le Scriptorium grew out of my passion for writing. Discovering the world of fan fiction and sharing my own stories made me realize how important it is to have a space where budding writers can express themselves freely. Too often, we think of writing as a solitary pursuit, but the opposite is true: it can be a real collective journey, rich in exchange and mutual inspiration.

With Le Scriptorium, I wanted to create a community of authors and readers, a place where everyone can grow in their writing, learn from others and share their passion for words. Whether you write for pleasure, to improve yourself, or have the ambition to publish one day, this is the site for you.

So whether you're a first-time author or a seasoned veteran, a curious reader or a seasoned critic, there's a place for you here. Together, we're building a community where every feather can fly higher.

**Best regards,**
